<h1>Exoskeleton2</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Exoskeleton2 is collection of mesh generation components for <a href="www.grasshopper3d.com">Grasshopper</a>. Its components are used to either wrap or thicken existing geometric elements in the modelling space. It also relies upon the libraries <a href="https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon">Rhinocommon</a> for functionality in Rhino and <a href="https://github.com/Dan-Piker/Plankton">Plankton</a> for n-gon, half-edge mesh operations.

<h2>Current Components</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cytoskeleton</strong> - This is a wireframe thickening tool, intended for 3d printing use. It works exclusively on lines which form the edges of meshes. The additional connectivity information present in this case makes it possible to produce an output with all quads, and moreover, a quad mesh with all even valence vertices. Because it works on a Plankton mesh, the input can be made of ngons. We can also input a triangular mesh, apply the dual operation, and then thicken the edges of the resulting polygon mesh.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Exo Wireframe</strong> - Another thickening tool, this transforms node-based wireframes into meshes. Input a network of lines to return a solid mesh.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Components</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Exo Curve</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Isosurface Wrapper</strong>
</li>
</ul>
